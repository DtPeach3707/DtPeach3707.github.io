  <div id="about">
    <p> 
      I am a high school student who is interested in applying machine learning to physical phenomena. I am a mostly STEM-oriented person, but I also have other interests like creative writing and martial arts.

          I have experience programming in the following languages:
          <ul>
            <li> Python (a lot of experience, so I use it many ways, including for all the machine learning that I do)</li>
            <li> JavaScript (some experience, I use it mainly for websites and web extensions because I don't know libraries)</li>
            <li> Lua (a little bit of experience, I use it for the reading the memory of games I want to make bots to play)</li>
            <li> C# (barely any experiecnce, I used it for keyboard press detection and it's SendInput function)</li>
          </ul>
        </td>
        <td id="researcht" style="opacity: 0.0;">
          Although I do not have too much research experience yet, I'm planning on working as an intern in the near future!
        </td>
        <td id="othexpt" style="opacity: 0.0;">
          I have been doing CAD and Mechanical for my FRC Robotics Team. Additionally, I have participated in some solo CAD competitions, where you have to design an entire robot for a week.
